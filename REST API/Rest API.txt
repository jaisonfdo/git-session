 This session was about rest api.This was muy repository about the rest,As the world of software technology is exploding and new softwares are created frequently, it is becoming a challenge to adapt a software completely. The primary challenges are compatibility and scalability.

When an organization invests its revenues in a particular software, they expect that the software should suffice their requirements over a period of time but soon they get stuck with challenges where the software is not able to communicate properly to the legacy softwares. To enable these communications, software industry came up with the concept of Application Program Interface (API). An API can specify how the software components will interact with each other. With the emergence of the API concepts, it became easier for the software developers to ensure the components can communicate to each other in a well-defined way. An API can be created for web based system, database system, operating system, software library or even for the computer hardware.

The organizations faced another challenge soon, with the emergence of Internet. Companies were finding it difficult to establish the communication between the Internet and the computer systems using various softwares and operating systems. To overcome the roadblock, RESTful API was created.
